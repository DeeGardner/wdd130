                Site Purpose
            </h2>
            <p>
                We live in an unprecedented time, more information is finger-taps away than was available in all of the last 3,000 years combined. The big problem we face then isn’t where is it all? It’s how, and what matters most, because it’s all available. I’m proposing we build a centralized hub where important information is organized and summarized in easy to access and understand chunks. Essentially the website would allow access to information that’s clear, concise and appropriate on a broad range of topics. If someone wanted to learn something they would go here, because the answer would be clear, organized, concise, and true, delivered in a bit sized chunk without distraction or fluff. It could change the way we study, learn, look for answer etc. Help us learn, not just intake.

                Target Audience
            </h2>
            <p>
                Packets' target audience ranges from teenage users, all the way up to senior citizens. Specifically it's for students and people who would prefer clean concise packets of information over the vast dumps of information available online.

            <ul>
                <li>The service would be free to use, but funded by donations.</li>
                <li>We'd like to provide a steamlined and simplistic layout that's clear for all users. The simple layout would reflect our commitment to simplicity and concise presentation.</li>
                <li>Similarly it would be preferable to keep only essential functionality as the power of this platform comes from it's singular purpose of well presented information.</li>
                <li>We would like to avoid stores or banners that may distract users.</li>
                <li>We would like to draw in users who want specific and clear information, or users seeking information they can understand and trust.</li>
                <li>We would like to provide a broad range of information covering many topics as possible, but easily navigatable.</li>
                <li>Information should be organized in concise and accurate bite sized packets that wouldn't take over 10 minutes to read.</li>
            </ul>
