        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          We live in an unprecedented time, more information is finger-taps away
          than was available in all of the last 3,000 years combined. The big
          problem we face then isn’t where is it all? It’s how, and what matters
          most, because it’s all available. I’m proposing we build a centralized
          hub where important information is organized and summarized in easy to
          access and understand chunks. Essentially the website would allow
          access to information that’s clear, concise and appropriate on a broad
          range of topics. If someone wanted to learn something they would go
          here, because the answer would be clear, organized, concise, and true,
          delivered in a bit sized chunk without distraction or fluff. It could
          change the way we study, learn, look for answer etc. Help us learn,
          not just intake.

        <h2>Site Map</h2>
        <p>
          Because of the minimalist mission of the website all pages will bw
          minimal in nature. Idealy the website would consist of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A landing page.</li>
          <li>
            Some kind of search result or topic presentation or selection page.
          </li>
          <li>
            An information packet page for the topic selected where the
            information is presented.
          </li>
          <li>A simple contribution form page.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Site Content</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Landing Page:</strong> The landing page should be focuesed on
          the principle of less is more, avoiding any clutter as possible. It
          could contain a main search bar or invitation to select a topic, and a
          short description of website services below that. The website would
          have a simple footer with social media links etc. Specifically the
          footer would provide an invitation link to contribute.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Result Page</strong> The result page would include a search
          bar or topic link selection for users to re-search or select if
          needed. The page would show results based on a users search input or
          topic selection, and would simply list the website's available
          information packet titles as links which lead to the information
          packets. The page would include some minimal filter options to refine
          by no more than 10 topics. The page would include means to get back to
          the main landing and a consistent footer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Packet Page</strong> The packet page would present concise and
          relevant information that does not extend over 10 minutes if possible.
          It would list reading time, an information accuracy rating, and a
          means to return to the main menu or search results page as well as
          consistent footer.
        </p>

        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>
          Packets' target audience ranges from teenage users, all the way up to
          senior citizens. Specifically it's for students and people who would
          prefer clean concise packets of information over the vast dumps of
          information available online.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The service would be free to use, but funded by donations.</li>
          <li>
            We'd like to provide a steamlined and simplistic layout that's clear
            for all users. The simple layout would reflect our commitment to
            simplicity and concise presentation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Similarly it would be preferable to keep only essential
            functionality as the power of this platform comes from it's singular
            purpose of well presented information.
          </li>
          <li>
            We would like to avoid stores or banners that may distract users.
          </li>
          <li>
            We would like to draw in users who want specific and clear
            information, or users seeking information they can understand and
            trust.
          </li>
          <li>
            We would like to provide a broad range of information covering many
            topics as possible, but easily navigatable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Information should be organized in concise and accurate bite sized
            packets that wouldn't take over 10 minutes to read.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <p>
          Right now I'd like to use 3 basic colors, an off white, a faded red,
          and a faded green. That would be extent of my colors.
        </p>
        <p class="white">EDECDC</p>
        <p class="green">74A995</p>
        <p class="red">7F292F</p>

        <h2>Fonts</h2>
        <p>
          For fonts I would like to use the one in use for this siteplan.
          Trebuchet MS
        </p>
        <p class="roboto">
          In some instances I would also like to use Roboto Mono.

        <h2>Media</h2>
        <p>
          I'd like to use images sparingly on the website, most media would be
          icons. I've included a few below that may be used, or at least have
          potential.
        </p>
        <img
          class="student"
          src="images/student.png"
          alt="A student studying"
        />
        <img
          class="icon"
          src="images/dot_grid.png"
          alt="Icon of dots in a grid"
        />
        <img
          class="icon"
          src="images/dots_black.png"
          alt="Icon containing black dots"
        />
        <img class="icon" src="images/filter.png" alt="Filter icon" />
        <img class="icon" src="images/magnifier.png" alt="Magnifier icon" />
