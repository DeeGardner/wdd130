        <p>Hi my name is Dee Gardner, I am from <strong>Salmon Idaho.</strong> I like hiking, camping, writing, drawing etc. I served my mission in <strong>Santa Rosa California</strong> and loved it there. I love <em>mint chocolate chip icecream</em> and <em>spending time with my family.</em> Right now I'm attending BYUI and majoring in computer science. I love coding in HTML, I actually took the time to learn HTML and CSS once, but that was awhile ago and I no longer recall it all as clearly as I used to. Below is a more complete list of the things I like to do specifically.</p>
