          We live in an unprecedented time, more information is finger-taps away
          than was available in all of the last 3,000 years combined. The big
          problem we face isn’t where is it all? It’s how, and what matters
          most, because it’s all available. Packets answers these questions and
          more, we are a centralized hub where important information is
          organized and summarized in easy to access and understand chunks or
          “packets”. Essentially we provide access to information that’s clear,
          concise, and appropriate on a broad range of topics. People who really
          want to learn tend to end up here because this isn’t your normal
          research resource. Our mission is to change the way people study and
          learn by making the process easy and accessible,
        </p>
        <p>
          breezy, simple, and accurate. Answers here are clear, organized,
          concise, and true, delivered without distraction or fluff. Learn,
          instead of intake. Packets is run by a small team based in the United
          States of America, committed to inspiring real learning. Packets was
          founded to fight the confusion that makes learning so hard, in a world
          where information is so accessible. Our content is provided by
          qualified volunteers and each article is checked thoroughly before
          publication. We strive to never be a distraction to you while learning
          here and so refuse to show advertisements or other kinds of promotion.
          Instead we rely on donations from truth loving people to provide you
          with the quality content users come to expect here.<a
