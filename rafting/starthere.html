        <h1>What is so great about whitewater rafting?</h1>
        <p>
          What makes whitewater rafting great anyway? Let's describe a common
          day on the river, arise in the soft light of the early morning after a
          night spent sleeping under a beautiful starry sky. Have a hearty warm
          breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack
          your things and prepare for the day. The day is filled with some
          combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology,
          stories, and more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after
          setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or good company by
          the river, or explore around camp while your guides prepare your
          dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes, or grilled
          salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you won't forget the dutch oven
          brownies. After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be able
          to talk your guide into another story or two to send you off to bed
          under more stars than you thought were possible.

          Make sure to reserve your date now, we have limited runs on each river
