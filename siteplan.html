        <h3>Site Purpose with Goals</h3>
        <p>
          To provide a face for the Dry Oar Rafting Company, information, and
          resources for booking a rafting trip. It should also be a useful
          marketing tool. It should provide trip expectations and preparation
          instructions including directions. It should also include testimonials
          and experiences. It should include a small merchandise store.

        <h3>Target Audience</h3>
        <p>
          What will weather look like during my trip? How can we ensure
          appropriate weather?
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it worth booking a rafting trip, and how? How can we make it easy
          and attracrtive?
        </p>
        <p>How much is it. How can we justify the cost?</p>
        <p>Is it simple to do? How can we make the process smooth?</p>
        <p>
          How do I prepare for a trip or reference my booked trip’s information.
          How can we make information accessible?
        </p>
        <p>If customers are looking to book a trip, what will sell them?</p>
        <p>
          How can we target a middle age audience which includes their family.
        </p>
        <p>
          How can we appear honest. What promises or commitments do we need to
          make?
        </p>
        <p>
          How can we prepare clients effectively. How can we effectively provide
          information and expectations, as well as advice? Would a help forum be
          worthwhile? Or a FAQ page?
        </p>
        <p>
          How can we gather testimonials and experiences from customers? We need
          a post survey likely.
